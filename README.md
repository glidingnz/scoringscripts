IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!

The Class Names in SeeYou Soaringspot must be correctly configured so that the script knows how to apply minimum distances and handicaps

When setting up the contest on SoaringSpot, Rename the existing SoaringSpot Contest Classes as follows .....


'club'      =   'Club'                  //  NZ Club Class   
'open'      =   'Open'                  //  NZ Open Class   
'standard'  =   'Racing'                //  NZ Racing Class   
'13_5_meter' =  'Sports'                //  NZ Sportsa (Novice) Class   
'18_meter'  =   '18M Unhandicapped'     //  Unofficial Class (unhandicapped)   
'15_meter'  =   'Racing Unhandicapped'  //  Unofficial Class (unhandicapped)   
'unknown'   =   'Open Unhandicapped'    //  Unofficial Class (unhandicapped)   
'double_seater'  = '2 Seater'           //  Unofficial Class (uncandicapped)
